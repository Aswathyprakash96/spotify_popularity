Music Popularity Prediction with Python
Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the popularity of music tracks using Python. By analyzing audio features and metadata, the model estimates how popular a song might be, helping artists and marketers make data-driven decisions.

Dataset
The dataset contains 227 music tracks with features like energy, loudness, tempo, and metadata such as track name, artist, and album.

Workflow
Load and preprocess the data (remove unnecessary columns, handle missing values).

Select relevant features for prediction.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train a Linear Regression model.

Evaluate the model performance using Mean Squared Error.

Visualize the results for better understanding.

Results
The model predicts song popularity with reasonable accuracy.

Performance can be improved by experimenting with other algorithms or adding more features.

Future Improvements
Try other regression models like Random Forest or XGBoost.

Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.

Add more contextual features like genre or artist popularity.
