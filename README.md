üéµ Music Popularity Prediction with Python
üìò Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict the popularity of music tracks using Python. By analyzing various audio features and metadata, the model estimates a song's popularity, aiding music producers, artists, and marketers in making informed decisions.

üß™ Objective
To develop a regression model that forecasts the popularity of songs based on features like energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

üìä Dataset
The dataset comprises 227 music tracks, each described by their music features and additional metadata such as track name, artists, album name, and release date. You can download the dataset from here.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-popularity-prediction.git
cd music-popularity-prediction
Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then set up a virtual environment and install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, install the dependencies globally:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
üßæ Steps
Import necessary libraries:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
Load the dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
spotify_data = pd.read_csv("Spotify_data.csv")
spotify_data.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0'], inplace=True)
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Convert categorical variables to numerical ones if necessary.

Normalize or scale features as required.

Feature Selection:

Identify and select relevant features that contribute to predicting popularity.

Model Training:

python
Copy
Edit
X = spotify_data.drop(columns=['Popularity'])
y = spotify_data['Popularity']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation:

python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
üìà Results
The model's performance can be assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ score. Visualizations such as scatter plots and residual plots can help in understanding the model's predictions.

üß† Further Improvements
Experiment with different regression algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost.

Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

Incorporate additional features like artist popularity or genre.
